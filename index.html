        <p>
          Let's build some happy little clouds up here. There are no limits in
          this world. Go out on a limb - that's where the fruit is. We have all
          at one time or another mixed some mud. If we're gonna walk though the
          woods, we need a little path. If you overwork it you become a cloud
          killer. There's nothing worse than a cloud killer.

          <p>
            Maybe there's a happy little waterfall happening over here. Give him
            a friend, we forget the trees get lonely too. Maybe we got a few
            little happy bushes here, just covered with snow. You don't have to
            be crazy to do this but it does help. A happy cloud.

          <p>
            Look at them little rascals. We'll put all the little clouds in and
            let them dance around and have fun. I'm gonna start with a little
            Alizarin crimson and a touch of Prussian blue You can work and
            carry-on and put lots of little happy things in here. Just let go -
            and fall like a little waterfall.

          <h2>Motivation</h2>
          <p>
            Just use the old one inch brush. Let's make a happy little mountain
            now. I started painting as a hobby when I was little. I didn't know
            I had any talent. I believe talent is just a pursued interest.
            Anybody can do what I do. See there how easy that is. Now let's put
            some happy little clouds in here.
